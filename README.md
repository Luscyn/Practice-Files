MERN Stack Practice Files

This repository contains my project files as I learn and practice building applications with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

## About

I am currently on a one-month journey to learn the MERN stack. My goal is to build a simple application that helps me:

- Develop and solidify my understanding of each technology in the stack
- Practice connecting frontend and backend
- Deploy a full-stack application

Feel free to explore the code, use it as a reference, and share feedback!

## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB** — NoSQL database
- **Express.js** — Backend framework for Node.js
- **React** — Frontend library
- **Node.js** — Runtime environment
